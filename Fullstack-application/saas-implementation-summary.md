# SaaS Multi-Tenancy Implementation Summary

## Backend Changes (FastAPI)

### User Model Adaptations
- Added subscription fields (stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, subscription_status)
- Implemented API key generation and validation
- Added verification and reset token fields for secure account management

### Multi-Tenant Data Access
- Updated API endpoints to filter data by user_id:
  - chat.py - All chat endpoints now filter conversations by the authenticated user's ID
  - products.py - Product management endpoints restrict access to user-specific products
  - widget_config.py - Configuration endpoints ensure settings are scoped to the authenticated user

### Authentication & Security
- Implemented dependency for API key validation and active subscription verification
- Added role-based access control for different user types (admin, customer)
- Enhanced password handling with secure hashing and verification

### MongoDB Indexes
- Created indexes on user_id fields across all collections
- Added compound indexes for efficient filtering and sorting
- Implemented unique constraints where appropriate

## Frontend Changes

### Management Dashboard
- Created AuthContext for centralized authentication state management
- Implemented secure token storage and API communication
- Added subscription management interface with Stripe integration

### Widget CSS Modularization
- Converted global CSS to CSS Modules:
  - App.css → App.module.css
  - index.css → index.module.css 
  - headingFix.css → headingFix.module.css
- Updated import statements in App.js and index.js
- Added scoped class names to prevent style conflicts

### Widget Security
- Implemented secure API key handling
- Added user-specific data loading
- Enhanced error handling for subscription and authentication issues

## Stripe Integration
- Added subscription plan creation and management
- Implemented webhook handling for subscription events
- Added secure payment processing with customer portal support

## Security Enhancements

This implementation provides a complete SaaS layer that enables:
1. User self-service signup and management
2. Secure multi-tenant data isolation
3. Subscription-based access control
4. Streamlined widget deployment with tenant-specific configurations
